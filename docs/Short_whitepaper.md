# YIELDLOOP — VERIFIED SETTLEMENT PROTOCOL (VSP)
## Prospectus + Whitepaper + Campaign (7-Section Edition)

> **Document Purpose:** A short, regulator-aware, user-readable prospectus that explains what YieldLoop is, why it exists, how it works, and what risks users accept — without hype.

# Section 1 — What YieldLoop Is (Category + Promise)

YieldLoop is a non-custodial **Verified Settlement Protocol (VSP)**.

A **Verified Settlement Protocol** is financial infrastructure that:
- Executes user-authorized strategies within fixed accounting windows
- Verifies whether real economic surplus exists only after execution concludes
- Settles outcomes exclusively at defined settlement points
- Refuses to recognize projected, unrealized, or smoothed profit

YieldLoop is built around one rule:

**If profit cannot be verified, it does not count.**

Each cycle produces only one of two outcomes:
- **Verified Profit**
- **Zero Profit**

YieldLoop is not a fund, not a bank, and not an asset manager. It is execution + verification + settlement infrastructure.

**Tagline:** Execution. Verification. Settlement.


# Section 2 — The Problem With Yield

Most financial and DeFi systems treat profit as a **story**, not a fact.

Common industry practices include:
- Projected APYs that ignore execution costs and slippage
- Inflationary rewards that mask losses
- Continuous balance updates that never settle
- Incentives to report performance before outcomes are complete

These systems blur the line between **expected profit** and **real surplus**.

As a result:
- Users cannot tell what was actually earned
- Losses are often hidden inside emissions or smoothing
- Performance becomes a narrative instead of an outcome

YieldLoop rejects this model entirely.

YieldLoop treats profit as something that must be:
- Finished
- Measured
- Verified
- Settled

Until execution ends and verification occurs, profit does not exist.


# Section 3 — How YieldLoop Works (In One Cycle)

YieldLoop operates in fixed execution cycles with deterministic accounting.

Each cycle follows the same sequence:

1. **User Authorization**  
   The user selects strategy parameters manually or through optional Guardrail Configuration and explicitly authorizes execution before the cycle begins.

2. **Cycle Execution**  
   Capital is deployed into predefined strategies for the full duration of the cycle. No configuration changes or interventions are permitted once execution starts.

3. **Execution Halt**  
   At cycle end, all strategy activity stops. No positions remain active beyond the cycle boundary.

4. **Verification**  
   Final vault balances are measured after all execution costs, gas fees, slippage, and losses are accounted for.

5. **Settlement**  
   - If surplus exists, verified profit is settled.
   - If no surplus exists, the cycle closes flat.

There are no mid-cycle withdrawals, no discretionary controls, and no performance smoothing.

Each cycle ends in accounting finality.


# Section 4 — Guardrails, Control, and Responsibility

YieldLoop does not manage user assets or make discretionary decisions.

All execution behavior is determined by **user-authorized parameters** selected before a cycle begins. Once a cycle starts, those parameters are locked and cannot be modified until settlement.

Users may configure strategies in one of two ways:

### Manual Configuration
Users directly select:
- Which strategies are enabled
- Allocation limits
- Execution constraints and bounds

Manual configuration places full responsibility for parameter selection on the user.

### Guardrail Configuration (Optional)
Guardrail Configuration is a rules-based system that assists users in selecting conservative parameters prior to cycle initiation.

Guardrail Configuration:
- Operates only before execution begins
- Uses predefined, governance-approved rule sets
- Enforces conservative limits and safety boundaries
- Does not predict market behavior
- Does not optimize for profit
- Does not adapt or intervene during execution

Guardrails exist to reduce configuration error, not to produce outcomes.

All responsibility for participation, configuration choice, and results remains with the user.


# Section 5 — Settlement, LOOP, and the Redemption Floor

YieldLoop settles outcomes only after execution concludes and verification is complete.

When a cycle ends with verified surplus, settlement occurs using **LOOP**, the protocol’s settlement token.

### LOOP (Settlement Token)

LOOP is issued exclusively as a result of verified profit and functions as a settlement receipt within the protocol.

LOOP:
- Is minted **only after** verified surplus exists
- Is fully backed at issuance
- Is redeemable within the protocol
- Has no emissions
- Has no governance rights
- Does not represent ownership, equity, or a claim on future profit

LOOP is not a reward or incentive mechanism. It exists solely to represent settled outcomes.

### The Redemption Floor

The LOOP redemption floor reflects the amount of backing held by the protocol at the time of redemption.

The floor is **designed to be non-decreasing under normal operating conditions**, subject to smart contract risk and external infrastructure failure.

YieldLoop does not guarantee redemption outcomes and does not intervene in secondary markets to influence price behavior.



# Section 6 — Fees, Risk, and Regulatory Posture

YieldLoop uses a performance-based fee model aligned with verified outcomes.

### Fees

YieldLoop charges a **20% performance fee on verified profit only**.

- No fees are charged on principal
- No fees are charged during flat or losing cycles
- No management fees
- No withdrawal or exit fees

If no verified profit exists, the fee is zero.

### Risk Disclosure

Participation in YieldLoop involves risk, including but not limited to:
- Market volatility and strategy underperformance
- Smart contract vulnerabilities
- Gas fees and execution costs
- Infrastructure, oracle, or integration failures

YieldLoop does not provide insurance, guarantees, or assurances of profit.

### Regulatory Posture

YieldLoop is a non-custodial protocol and does not provide investment advice, asset management, or discretionary control.

As a U.S.-based entity, YieldLoop’s user interface may implement sanctions screening consistent with applicable **Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC)** requirements at the application layer.

YieldLoop operates as settlement infrastructure, not as a financial intermediary.


# Section 7 — Who YieldLoop Is For (And Who It Is Not)

YieldLoop is designed for users who value:
- Verification over projection
- Settlement over narratives
- Discipline over hype
- Transparency over promises

YieldLoop may be appropriate for users who understand that:
- Profit is not guaranteed
- Cycles may close flat
- Execution costs can exceed returns
- Outcomes are finalized only at settlement

YieldLoop is **not** designed for:
- Users seeking guaranteed or predictable returns
- Users who expect continuous liquidity
- Users who want active management or advice
- Users who are unwilling to accept smart contract or market risk

YieldLoop does not promise upside.

YieldLoop proves reality.

**Execution happens.  
Results are verified.  
Outcomes are settled.**


# Section 8 — NFT Program & Referral Incentives
